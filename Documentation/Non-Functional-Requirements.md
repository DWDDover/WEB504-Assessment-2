# Part C: Non-Functional Requirements


## Performance Requirements

There are many performance requirements to consider when optimizing a website for fast loading times and smooth operation. These attributes lead to an overall more positive user experience, especially important in the case of the portfolio site, where things like loading times will be used as a metric by potential employers as an indicator of the portfolio owner's technical skill. These considerations include careful control of file sizes, efficient hosting, caching strategies, and testing using performance measuring tools such as Google Lighthouse.

Having appropriate file sizes for any media hosted on the site is important to having good performance and fast loading times for pages. For example, if there are any images on the portfolio site that will be used as a thumbnail, the size of the image should be reduced to the largest size that the image will realistically be displayed at. Various web design best practices state that a thumbnail should be no larger than 900x600px and a full width image no larger than 1600x900px [(Best Practices for Optimizing Images for the Web, n.d.)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?v3SM0G), the images hosted on the portfolio site will adhere to these best practices. Using a vector format whenever possible for images will also help keep file sizes small, vector files such as .SVG are stored as a series of lines and directions instead of pixels and can be scaled up to any size without losing quality, while keeping their file sizes small [(What Is an SVG File?, n.d.)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?MtqAma). 

Hosting also plays a large role in performance. The portfolio will be hosted on GitHub Pages, which provides fast, globally distributed content delivery via a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This means that because of its large network of servers, content can be distributed from the closest server to a user, reducing latency and increasing site performance. [(What Is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?, n.d.)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?QikQuF). Using GitHub Pages also ensures HTTPS is enforced by default, improving performance through HTTP/2 features like multiplexing. This reduces latency and improves overall page load speed. As the portfolio is static, github pages use of caching will also reduce server latency by storing the portfolio in the cache of whichever server the user is accessing for the duration of their browsing, reducing the need for repeated requests [(Hosting in GitHub Pages · Community · Discussion #64462, n.d.)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?0AJhjI).

Another important aspect of website performance is the use of browser caching. Since the portfolio is static, browser caching will be leveraged for assets such as images, fonts, and CSS files. This means that once these resources are loaded by the user's browser, they will be stored locally for the user and not need to be loaded repeatedly when navigating through different pages. The cache-control: HTTP header can be used to manually instruct browsers how long to keep static components in their cache [(Serve Static Assets with an Efficient Cache Policy | Lighthouse, n.d.)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Et1MG5).

To test if the portfolio is meeting performance requirements Google Lighthouse will be used on each page of the site. This is a tool built into the chrome browser that can analyze a web page and give different scores and metrics based on the page’s performance. It also gives metrics on a page's accessibility and SEO optimization [(Introduction to Lighthouse, n.d.)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?qD2lFt). Lighthouse also gives information on how to improve each of these metrics. The portfolio site will need a score of at least 85 in the performance category.


## Security Considerations

While this is a static website, there are still some important security considerations and requirements. One of these requirements is that all parts of the web site are served over HTTPS and not HTTP. HTTPS uses end to end encryption to protect data in transit between a server and a client [(What Is HTTPS?, n.d.)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?rZ2BYS). Hosting the site on GitHub pages ensures that any traffic is over HTTPS by default. Another security requirement is that the site contains limited personal information, only that which is necessary to contact the portfolio owner, and links only to business facing social media or other sites, such as LinkedIn and GitHub, and not more personal pages such as facebook or instagram. These links that are on the site should also be secure and only to addresses that are also served over HTTPS .


## Usability and Access Requirements

There are many considerations that can be made when designing a web page that will improve the page's accessibility for all users. These requirements and considerations are laid in existing documentation, such as the ‘Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)’ or the ‘A11y Project’. Some of these requirements are focused on the pages content, such as writing in plain readable language,  having descriptive, intuitive text on buttons, links, and other interactive content, and having the correct text alignment direction [(Checklist - The A11Y Project, n.d.)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?1F1ChK). Other accessibility requirements are more focused on the structure of the HTML or the inclusion of specific accessibility attributes.

One such accessibility requirement for the portfolio site is the use of semantic HTML. This means appropriately using semantic HTML elements, meaning ones that describe their own meaning such as &lt;header>, &lt;footer>, or &lt;nav>, wherever possible. These tags will help users with screen readers when navigating a page, by signposting and helping to move through the different sections without having to rely on the content of each element for context [(Semantics - Glossary | MDN, 2025)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?nL49jE). Using semantic HTML also has SEO benefits from highlighting the importance of some terms on the page, such as those included in a page’s &lt;h1> or &lt;h2> elements.

Another requirement is the use of ARIA attributes in some HTML elements of the portfolio site. WAI-ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, defines a way to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities [(Initiative (WAI), n.d.)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Ym3PrZ). This is done through the inclusion of attributes such as aria-label that describe the role or state of an element in the context of an accessibility device. The aria-label attribute is used to label things like buttons or navigation controls that don’t have a description in their inner HTML. For example, if closing a popup on a page required clicking a small ‘x’ button, that button element would include the attribute aria-label=”close”, indicating its purpose to screen readers or other accessibility devices that a user might have. This is one of many kinds of ARIA attributes that should be included whenever necessary in a page’s HTML [(ARIA - Accessibility | MDN, 2025)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?YxfDh9).

Some more requirements for the portfolio site’s accessibility are the inclusion of fieldset labels, alt attributes, and tab indexes. Fieldset labels are used to associate an input with a specific label text. When a user with a screen reader focuses an input, the correct label text will be read out, allowing the user to effectively fill out forms or other inputs on a page [(&lt;fieldset>, 2025)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?zVcYpr). An alt attribute is used to describe a multimedia HTML element such as an image or video. Any such element that isn’t purely decorative requires an alt attribute in order for visually impaired users to understand an element's content. The tabindex is used to control how elements on a page will be focused by users navigating without the use of a mouse or other pointer. It can be used to set the order in which elements on a page are focused with the tab key, or to increase efficiency for those users by disabling the ability to focus non-interactive content [(HTML Tabindex Global Attribute - HTML | MDN, 2025)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?5kaj9w).

Another accessibility requirement for the site is a system of visual feedback for user interactions with some elements. Users need clear feedback when they are focusing or hovering over an interactive element, either through borders, contrasting alternate colors, or mouse pointer styles [(Mattson, 2021)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Cp4HPt). This feedback will be implemented through :focus, :hover, and :active CSS selectors for any buttons or links on the portfolio site. This will prevent users from clicking or selecting links or buttons that they did not intend to.


## Responsive Design

In order for the portfolio site to be optimised and functional for the largest possible set of users, the website needs to be designed to be responsive. This means that the layouts and components on each page that are displayed to the user can adjust to all screen sizes, devices, and browsers without losing  their proper structure [(Responsive Web Design - Learn Web Development | MDN, 2025)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?S9geEG). This can be done by using flexible CSS display types, such as flex box or grid, defining the sizes of elements through percentages, fractions, and the view height and view width units, or using media queries to define which styles apply to which screen sizes.

Some CSS display types, such as grid or flex box, combined with the use of units that can automatically adjust to a devices display, such as fractions or viewheight, allowing for layout structures to be resized without losing their shape and structure. In a flex box, items grow and shrink depending on the size of their container, the ‘flex’ CSS rule can also be used to define how much space an item will take up in its container.

Media queries are a technique to tweak CSS styles depending on the properties of a device's screen, such as height and width. These queries can be used to change the values of a CSS style, such as the size of an element's margins or padding, add new properties, such as maximum or minimum sizes for images, or to completely hide or reveal certain elements. The ability to have control over which styles apply at which screen size allows for much more responsive design and a positive experience for a wider range of users.

The proper use of these techniques should be applied to the portfolio site in order for it to be designed in a responsive way. In order to minimize the risk of any non-responsiveness, the site should be tested with a range of display sizes by resizing browser windows to any realistic size that a user might have. Chrome's developer tools can also be used as they provide the ability to simulate the viewport of most common mobile and tablet devices.


## Search Engine Optimisation

The portfolio site requires good search engine optimization (SEO) in order to align with many of the main user goals such as building an online presence, being seen by potential employers, and allowing any other users to find their content. A properly optimized site is more likely to show up in the results of a search engine, and likely to appear higher in that search, and in searches where the site's content is relevant. It will also help the site be seen and read by crawlers that are being used to gather data such as an AI that has been tasked with finding potential employees for a company based on certain keywords [(What Is a Web Crawler?, n.d.)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?AtMmtx). There are a number of considerations that can help the portfolio site achieve the best possible SEO, such as indexing speed and performance, use of certain HTML elements, and off-page SEO.

One of the key considerations for SEO is the indexing speed and simplicity of a site. Search engines use crawlers to browse the web and add pages to their indexes. Or in the case of AI the crawler might browse the web and return relevant results based on a query or command. These crawlers need to be able to quickly and efficiently move through the pages of a site and read relevant information [(SEO Starter Guide, n.d.)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?hET2qz). This requires an intuitive website structure and internal linking, and pages that are well optimised for performance. Because the portfolio site is static, it will benefit from fast indexing and avoid the risk of some content being hidden because of JavaScript.

There are some elements and attributes of HTML that the portfolio site will include that will directly increase its SEO optimisation. As mentioned in the previous section, search engine indexes will place a higher importance on the inner HTML of some page elements. These are things like a page's headings, and title. Because of this it is important that each page has a good relevant title and headings, and that each section of content is labelled by a clear heading that describes that section's content. The meta tag can also provide descriptions of a page that is not visible to end users but can be seen and used for search indexing. It can contain things like a description of the page, certain keywords relevant to the page's content, and information about the page’s author [(HTML Meta Tag, n.d.)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?XJW4cF). Another HTML element that the site will use for SEO is the ‘alt’ attribute. This attribute is used to describe a multimedia element on a page so that search engines can understand that element's purpose and content. Another HTML tag that will improve the SEO of the site is the ‘canonical’ tag. This tag is a link in the head section of an HTML page that informs search engines which page should be prioritised in the case of pages with repeated content [(How To Add a Canonical Tag in HTML?, 18:04:31+00:00)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?2sqDnb).

Another consideration for increasing the portfolio site’s SEO is the use of off page SEO. This refers to any SEO factors that come from outside the site, such as the frequency of links to the page on other sites, and on where these links appear. This can be done by posting links to the portfolio site on other pages, such as content the portfolio owner has written on another site, or an aggregation of links to pages on an article about portfolio pages [(What Is Off-Page SEO?, n.d.)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?kfnpEx).
