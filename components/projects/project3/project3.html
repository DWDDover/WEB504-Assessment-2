        <h2 class="project title">Patient Record System</h2>
        <p class="p1">
          This project focused on developing a proof of concept for a patient profile management 
          system designed for use by healthcare providers. The system allows for storing, editing, 
          and retrieving patient personal and medical information, including names, contact details, 
          unique IDs, notes, and medical records. It was built as a Node.js command-line application 
          and emphasizes efficiency, accessibility, and reliability in managing patient records. The 
          project followed the Agile XP methodology, ensuring rapid iteration, testing, and adaptability 
          to feedback during development.
        </p>
        <p class="p1">
          The application was designed with clear functionality: adding new patients, viewing and exporting 
          patient lists, editing and updating profiles, deleting records, and searching for patients by 
          various identifiers. To ensure maintainability and scalability, reusable functions and DRY (Don’t 
          Repeat Yourself) principles were applied. Menus and user interactions were structured using arrays 
          and objects, allowing easy extension or modification of features. The system also included CSV 
          export capabilities and persistent data storage in JSON format, ensuring records are not lost 
          between sessions.
        </p>

        <p class="p1">
          Testing played a crucial role in the project, with both manual and automated approaches employed. 
          Manual testing focused on input validation, patient profile operations, and CSV export 
          reliability. Automated testing, implemented with Mocha and Sinon, ensured the robustness of 
          functions such as patient selection, table printing, and search features. Debugging during this 
          stage helped identify and resolve issues, including missing input validation and persistence of 
          edits to the JSON file, which improved the system’s reliability.

        <p class="p1">
          Overall, the project demonstrated a strong software engineering approach by combining structured 
          design, iterative development, and rigorous testing. The outcome was a fully functioning patient 
          profile management proof of concept that not only meets core requirements but is also flexible 
          enough for future improvements. The system showcases efficient coding practices, strong project 
          management, and practical solutions for real-world healthcare data management challenges.
