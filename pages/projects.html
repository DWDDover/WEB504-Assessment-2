                    <p>
                        A series of mockups and prototypes for 
                        the payment system of a mobile
                        banking application. I completed this 
                        project as part of a larger study on the UI/UX 
                        development process.

                    <h2>Mobile Payment UI</h2>
                    <p>
                        I began with UI research, analyzing existing apps to identify 
                        strengths and weaknesses. Common issues included small text, unclear navigation, and 
                        inefficient ways to manage payees.

                    <h2>High-fidelity Mockups</h2>
                    <p>
                        I then created user personas and developed wireframes to explore solutions. 
                        Key design improvements included quick access to frequent payees, consistent 
                        button styles, and better readability through larger text and 
                        high-contrast colors.

                    <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                    <p>
                        I then created mockups of the UI for each step of the payment process. The final prototype 
                        delivers a streamlined three-step payment flow: select payee, enter details, 
                        confirm transaction. It introduces practical enhancements such as repeat payment shortcuts, 
                        and easy new-payee options.

                        This project focused on developing a proof of concept for a patient profile management 
                        system designed for use by healthcare providers. The system allows for storing, editing, 
                        and retrieving patient personal and medical information. It was built as a Node.js command-line application.

                    <p>
                        The application was designed with clear functionality: adding new patients, viewing and exporting 
                        patient lists, editing and updating profiles, deleting records, and searching for patients by 
                        various identifiers. To ensure maintainability and scalability, reusable functions and DRY principles were applied.

                        Testing played a crucial role in the project, with both manual and automated approaches employed. 
                        Manual testing focused on input validation, patient profile operations, and CSV export 
                        reliability. Automated testing was implemented with Mocha and Sinon.

                    <p>
                        A series of science infographics made for Land Air Water Aotearoa.
                        I designed and created these infographics as part of an online 2020 
                        information campaign about groundwater processes.

                    <p>
                        For this project, I was given a series of groundwater processes and information and some hand drawn 
                        diagrams with explanations. I was asked to design more modern infographics based on these for a 2020

                        in the extraction of water, and the ways in which different sediment types effect the flow of groundwater.
                        The diagrams were created in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop with close collaboration with experts.
